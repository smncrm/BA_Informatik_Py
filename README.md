# Minimum-Based Altruism in Coalition Formation Games

This repository contains the code I wrote and used to study ACFGs in regards of their core stability and popularity.


 * In [min_acfg.py](min_acfg.py) is the code to represent ACFGs and the methods needed to study them.
 * I use the notebook [coalition_structures](coalition_structures.ipynb) to test out some ACFGs.
